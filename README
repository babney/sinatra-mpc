This is pretty buggy and incomplete at the moment. No library support, no changing playlists, no nothing.

What works:
-view the current playlist
-play/pause
-next
-previous
-change to a track in the current playlist

Requirements:
-Sinatra
-jQuery
-the mpc gem, which does not seem to be on github, so I've included a monkeypatch to fix one apparent bug and add one method. If I'm wrong and it is on github I'll fork it and fix it, but this is it for now.
-an MPD server, set up to stream through icecast or the builtin streamer.

TODO:
-everything!
