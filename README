This is pretty buggy and incomplete at the moment. No library support, no changing playlists, no nothing.

What works:
-view the current playlist
-play/pause
-next
-previous
-change to a track in the current playlist

Requirements:
-Sinatra
-jQuery
-the mpc gem, (requires ruby-tree) which does not seem to be on github, so I've included a monkeypatch to fix one apparent bug and add one method. If I'm wrong and it is on github I'll fork it and fix it, but this is it for now.
-the json gem
-an MPD server, set up to stream through icecast or the builtin streamer.

TODO:
-fix song-end bug
-library/playlist CRUD support
-CSS and other beautification
-general drying up of the code, adding config files, etc.
-support for mp3 streams
-support for browsers other than chrome (firefox works if you use icecast instead of the builtin streamer. Maybe mpd isn't sending the MIME type?)
-graceful fallback to jorbis or other player for older browsers
