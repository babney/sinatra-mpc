This is pretty buggy and incomplete at the moment. No library support, no changing playlists, no nothing.

What works:
-view the current playlist
-play/pause
-next
-previous
-change to a track in the current playlist

Requirements:
-Sinatra
-jQuery
-the mpc gem, (requires ruby-tree), specifically my fork of it for now which fixes a small bug and adds a 'playing?' method
-the json gem
-an MPD server, set up to stream through icecast or the builtin streamer. Icecast seems to work better with Firefox.

TODO:
-fix song-end bug
-library/playlist CRUD support
-CSS and other beautification
-general drying up of the code, adding config files, etc.
-support for mp3 streams
-graceful fallback to jorbis or other player for older browsers
